## Getting started

To use the site locally, follow the following instructions:

1. Ensure you have installed Node.js at the same version as specified in the [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) file.
1. Clone this repository to your own machine.
1. From the root of the repository, install all the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
1. Run the development build, which will automatically update as you change files:
    ```sh
    npm run develop
    ```

Sometimes you want to be sure of exactly what will be produced in the CI build. If you want to run a full production build, you can do so using:
```sh
npm run build
```

You can then serve that production build using:
```sh
npm run serve
```

Note: If you are using a dev container within vscode, use this instead:
```sh
npm run serve -- --host 0.0.0.0
```
