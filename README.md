## To build and test the documentation locally
- make sure you have the required python packages installed: `pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`
- make sure your `gh-pages` branch reflects the current state of the version on the server :
`git branch --delete -D gh-pages ; git checkout -t origin/gh-pages ; git checkout {mybranch}`
- tell your `mike` tool that the default branch is the branch you are working on. For example: for the 'development' branch use `mike set-default development`
- run `mike deploy` to build the docs, and push them to your (local) branch of gh-pages.
- run `mike serve` to host the documentation on a local server
- browse your documentation by visiting http://localhost:8000/development/


## Release the documentation
- Create a release branch in `gh-pages` by using the git web user interface to create a release. Call it vx.yy.z. This will build and push the new content for the release into the gh-pages site.
- If you want that release to be marked as 'latest' then manually trigger the `releases-set-latest` workflow from the Github Actions dashbaord for this repository.
