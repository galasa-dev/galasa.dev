# The Galasa Configuration Property Store

Integration testing can be complicated. Tests often require configuration parameters to bind to a specific test environment. Galasa Managers require configuration so that systems under test can be contacted. This information needs to stored in a single, central repository that is shareable to the Galasa framework, Ecosystem, Managers and tests. Find out how Galasa solves these challenges by its use of the Configuration Property Store (CPS). Watch the video to understand the features of the Galasa CPS, and see a demonstration on manipulating the values in a CPS by using the Galasa command line (Galasa CLI). Use the information to help you to simplify your test configuration, set Ecosystem-wide configuration properties, and set parameters and credentials on the Ecosystem for tests to read and use at runtime.
