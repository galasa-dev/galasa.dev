Deep z/OS integration means you can verify data by interrogating the CICS application directly and gives you the ability to check other z/OS resources, such as messages on queues, without using stubs or mocking.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on the test \u2013 not the integration problems</p> <p>Galasa\u2019s framework enables deep integration tests to be run across multiple technologies. One test case can interact with 3270, Selenium, JMeter, batch jobs and more. When you\u2019re ready, Galasa integrates easily into your DevOps strategy, and can be used alongside other test tools.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Get the test data you need \u2013 fast</p> <p>Galasa can integrate with your test data strategy by helping you to provision new or existing test data records. Galasa can also lock test data so that many tests can run in parallel against the same test data pool, making it easy to repeat tests under identical conditions for swift debugging. Provisioned environments are automatically deprovisioned at test completion, leaving a clean test system state ready for the next tests.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>See the big picture \u2013 from one location</p> <p>Test results and artifacts are stored in a single location in a uniform style, enabling easy extraction of big picture information.
