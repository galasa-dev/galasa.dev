## What is DevOps?
 DevOps is a set of processes that enable development and operations teams to continuously deliver high quality software in a fast, reliable, repeatable way.  

## Benefits of Galasa as part of a DevOps strategy 
Galasa as part of a DevOps strategy can provide significant benefit in three key areas:

1.	<b>Faster time to value</b>

    Galasa provides the ability to automate integration tests in a repeatable and reliable way, enabling fast and efficient software delivery and reducing manual effort.

2.	<b>Increased capacity to innovate</b>

    Running your integration tests by using Galasa automation instead of running them manually saves time, freeing up people to work on higher-value activities, such as Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) or exploratory testing.

3.	<b>Enhanced customer experience</b>
    
    Galasa enables continuous testing, leading to faster, better quality builds. In agile projects, this means you can get early feedback from stakeholders about the software that’s being delivered.


## DevOps principles and Galasa
Galasa supports the following three key principles of DevOps:

 - <b>Develop and test against production-like systems</b>
    
    Galasa supports the DevOps concept "shift left", in which operational concerns move earlier in the delivery life cycle, toward development. Galasa tests can bind to a stubbed environment, a virtual machine, or a replica production environment without changing a single line of test code. Teams can test against systems that behave like production to see how the application behaves and performs well before it’s ready for deployment.    
    

 - <b>Deploy with repeatable, reliable processes</b>
 
    Galasa enables development to support an agile software development process all the way through from development to production by using automation to run tests that are iterative, frequent, repeatable, and reliable.
    

 - <b>Monitor and validate quality</b>

    When software is tested, Galasa stores the test artifacts in a single repository, making it quicker and easier to analyse and identify the cause of a failure. Test results are captured in a consistent format, making it simpler to compare results.
