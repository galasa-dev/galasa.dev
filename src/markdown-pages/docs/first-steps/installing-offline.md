title: "Installing the Galasa plug-in offline"
---

The Galasa _isolated.zip_ file is available from the <a href="https://resources.galasa.dev" target="_blank">https://resources.galasa.dev/</a> site and can be downloaded and extracted to a directory of your choice. The zip file contains three directories (eclipse, maven and javadoc), an `isolated.tar` file and a `docs.jar` file. 

The eclipse directory contains the Galasa plug-in, and the maven directory contains dependencies that are required for building Galasa tests. The javadoc directory contains the Javadoc API documentation for the Galasa Managers.

The `isolated.tar` file is an optional Docker image that hosts all the artifacts. You might want to use the Docker image if you want to host Galasa on an internal server that can be accessed by other users. If you want to host Galasa on your local machine only, you do not need to use the Docker image. 

The `docs.jar` file enables you to run the Galasa website locally on your machine or on an internal server. Instructions on how to do this are available in the `README.txt` that is provided in the Galasa zip file. 

## Getting started

Galasa installations can vary in complexity depending on the context in which it is used. Invariably though, all first-time installations begin with the Eclipse IDE (you can download it from <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer" target="_blank">the Eclipse website</a>) and the download and integration of the Galasa plug-in. The Galasa plug-in is accompanied by Galasa SimBank - a demonstration application - which sits on top of a very small middleware layer called SimPlatform (you may see its name in some console messages, but you will otherwise not need to interact with SimPlatform).

<!-- Later, you are likely to want to enhance your test capabilities and exploit Galasa's ability to integrate with automated CI/CD pipelines and a Kubernetes or equivalent container orchestration environment. Other similar but more complex scenarios are also possible, and may be required if your situation demands it. -->

This section describes the most common initial installation scenario - using Eclipse to install the Galasa plug-in - together with SimPlatform/SimBank - on your local machine and preparing it to run an initial set of provided tests against a simulated mainframe application.

## Prerequisites

Depending on how you use Galasa, there are several software prerequisites, some or all of which you may have already installed.

### Java

Galasa tests and Managers are written in Java - you will need to install a Java version 11 JDK or later to use it.

### Eclipse

If you do not already have an Eclipse installation, you can <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer" target="_blank">download</a> a version of Eclipse appropriate for your machine. Choose a package that supports your required level of Java development - _Eclipse IDE for Java Developers_ or _Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers_. If you are unsure, then the _Eclipse IDE for Java Developers_ should be fine, and you can always add plug-ins if and when you discover you need them.

If you already have a version of Eclipse installed, it should be at the version codenamed Photon (released in June 2018) or later. _Note:_ The Java 17 JDK causes Galasa test runs to fail. We recommend using a Java 11 or 16 JDK whilst we investigate this issue.

### Gradle 

You will need to install Gradle version 6.8.2 which is used to build the Galasa software. 

### Docker (Required if using the Docker image)

If you want to deploy the Docker image that is provided in the zip file, you will need to have Docker installed. 

### (Optional) A 3270 terminal emulator

Although you do not need a 3270 emulator to run a Galasa test (even if it tests a 3270 application) you can use one to explore Galasa Simbank, a simulated version of an application that helps you get acquainted with Galasa before connecting to a real mainframe to run your own tests. There are many such emulators available but IBM's Personal Communications (PCOMM) is frequently used, as is IBM's Host on Demand software, which includes support for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Getting started

Extract the contents of the zip file into a directory of your choice.

If you are using the zipped distribution hosted in Docker, ensure that you have the appropriate privileges to run Docker commands on the server on which you are hosting the Galasa artifacts and complete the following steps to load and run the Docker image: 

Note: The example uses port `8080` but you can use a different port.

1. Within the directory that contains the Docker image (`isolated.tar`), run the following command:
```
docker load -i isolated.tar
``` 

The following confirmation message is received: _Loaded image: icr.io/galasadev/galasa-distribution:latest_.

2. Run the container by using the following command: 
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name galasa icr.io/galasadev/galasa-distribution:latest
```

3. Go to `http:\\hostname:8080` to view the running container. 

You are now ready to install the Galasa plug-in. 

## <a name="installoffline"></a>Installing the Galasa plug-in

1. Launch Eclipse. If present, close any initial welcome screen.
1. Choose _Help > Install New Software_ from the main menu.
1. Choose from the following options: 
    1. If you have the zip extracted locally, complete the following steps:
        1. Click *Add* and then Select *Local*
        1. Navigate to the directory into which the zip was extracted, select the Eclipse directory, and click *OK*
        1. Check that the `Location` field is populated with the filepath information, for example, `file:///home/username/galasa-isolated-mvp/eclipse/` and press _Enter_.
    1. If you are using the Docker hosting mechanism, populate the `Location` field with the URL to the running container, for example, `http://hostname:8080/eclipse` and press _Enter_.
1. Tick the _Galasa_ box in the main panel, ensuring that _Galasa_ and all of its child elements are ticked and press _Next_.
1. Follow the prompts to download and install the Galasa plug-in. You will be asked to accept the terms of the license agreement and restart Eclipse to complete the installation. You may also be asked to acknowledge and agree that you are installing unsigned content.
1. After Eclipse has restarted, you can verify that the plug-in is now available by observing the presence of a new _Galasa_ option on the main menu between _Run_ and _Window_. If you choose _Run > Run Configurations_ from the main menu, you will also observe three new entries: _Galasa - Gherkin_, _Galasa - Java_ and _Galasa SimBank_ as available options in the left-hand panel of the pop-up window.

## Configuring Eclipse for Galasa

<!-- 1. If it is running, close Eclipse. -->
<!-- 1. Check to see if you have a `.galasa` folder in your user home directory - create it if there isn't one. On Windows, the user home directory resembles: `C:\Users\<username>`, on MacOS or Linux, entering `cd ~` in a terminal takes you to your user home directory, whatever it has been configured to be.
1. Create two empty files in your .galasa folder:
```
bootstrap.properties
dss.properties
``` -->

1. Choose _Galasa > Setup Galasa Workspace_ from the main Eclipse menu - this command creates some necessary configuration files. Your Eclipse console confirms its progress with some messages:

   ```
   Setting up the Galasa workspace
   Creating the ~/.galasa files
   Created the ~/.galasa directory
   Created an empty Bootstrap Properties file ~/.galasa/bootstrap.properties
   Created an empty Overrides Properties file ~/.galasa/overrides.properties
   Created an empty Credentials Properties file ~/.galasa/credentials.properties
   Created an empty CPS Properties file ~/.galasa/cps.properties
   Created an empty DSS Properties file ~/.galasa/dss.properties
   The ~/.m2 directory already exists
   Created the ~/.m2/.settings.xml example file
   Setup complete
   ```
1. Locate your user home directory and confirm it contains a `.galasa` folder. On Windows, the user home directory resembles: `C:\Users\<username>`, on MacOS it will be `/Users/<username>` and on Linux `/home/<username>`.  Note that any file or folder beginning with a `.` is a hidden folder, so you might need to change the settings on your operating system to show hidden files.
1. Edit a file called `overrides.properties` in your `.galasa` folder so that it contains:
   ```properties
   zos.dse.tag.SIMBANK.imageid=SIMBANK
   zos.dse.tag.SIMBANK.clusterid=SIMBANK

   simbank.dse.instance.name=SIMBANK
   simbank.instance.SIMBANK.zos.image=SIMBANK

   zos.image.SIMBANK.ipv4.hostname=127.0.0.1
   zos.image.SIMBANK.telnet.port=2023
   zos.image.SIMBANK.webnet.port=2080
   zos.image.SIMBANK.telnet.tls=false
   zos.image.SIMBANK.credentials=SIMBANK

   zosmf.image.SIMBANK.servers=SIMBANK
   zosmf.server.SIMBANK.image=SIMBANK
   zosmf.server.SIMBANK.port=2040
   zosmf.server.SIMBANK.https=false
   ```
1. Edit a file called `credentials.properties` in your `.galasa` folder so that it contains:

   ```properties
   secure.credentials.SIMBANK.username=IBMUSER
   secure.credentials.SIMBANK.password=SYS1
   ```

   Note: If you have previously installed Galasa, this file is already populated.
      <!-- 1. Create an `.m2` folder in your user home directory (the same place as your `.galasa` folder) and inside, place a `settings.xml` file with the contents:

```
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
