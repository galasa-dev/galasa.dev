title: "Deleting test run results"

Over time, test run results build up and take up space in the Galasa Ecosystem. You can delete test runs which have completed in the past by using the `galasactl runs delete` command.

You can view the full command syntax in the <a href="https://github.com/galasa-dev/cli/blob/main/docs/generated/galasactl_runs_delete.md" target="_blank">Galasa cli repository</a>.

## Working with the `galasactl runs delete` command

The following example deletes a test run called _C1234_: 

```
galasactl runs delete --name C1234 --bootstrap http://example.com:30960/bootstrap
```

## Identifying test runs to delete

Use the `galasactl runs get` command to find the names of the test runs to delete. For example, use the `--age` option to specify a time period in which the tests ran. 

```
galasactl runs get --age 6w:1w --bootstrap http://example.com:30960/bootstrap
```

The `--format raw` option is useful if you are writing a script to delete multiple test runs.
