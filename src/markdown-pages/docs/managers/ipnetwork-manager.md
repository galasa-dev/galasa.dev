## Overview
The IP Network Manager enables access to applications over TCP/IP networks for those   applications whose native communication is over TCP/IP. It can be used by other   application specific managers that will build upon the basic address capabilities   provided by the IP Network Manager.  <br><br>  The Manager interrogates the Configuration Properties Store (CPS) to get hostname                    and port information so that you do not need to hard-code these values into your tests.   <br><br>
