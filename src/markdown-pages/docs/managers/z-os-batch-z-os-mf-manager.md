**BETA - This Manager is feature complete but may contain known or unknown bugs.**

## Overview
This Manager is an internal implementation of the z/OS Batch Manager using z/OS MF. The z/OS MF Batch Manager is used in conjunction with the z/OS Manager. The z/OS Manager provides the interface for the z/OS batch function and pulls in the z/OS MF Batch Manager to provide the implementation of the interface. If your test needs to submit or monitor a batch job or retrieve output from a batch job, you can call the z/OS Manager in your test code and the z/OS Manager will call the z/OS MF Batch Manager to provide the implementation via the z/OS batch  function. For example, the <a href="/docs/running-simbank-tests/batch-accounts-open-test">BatchAccountsOpenTest</a>  uses the z/OS Manager (which in the background, invokes z/OS MF) to add a set of accounts to the Galasa SimBank  system via a z/OS batch job.  <p> The zOS Batch z/OS MF Manager is enabled by setting the CPS property:<br> <code>zos.bundle.extra.batch.manager=dev.galasa.zosbatch.zosmf.manager</code><br>  Galasa sets this property by default. <p> See the <a href="/docs/managers/zos-manager">zOS Manager</a> for details of the z/OS Batch annotations and code snippets.
