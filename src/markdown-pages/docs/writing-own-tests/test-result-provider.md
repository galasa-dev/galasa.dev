title: "Controlling code execution after test failure"

As a tester, you may want the ability to access the result so far of a Galasa test at different points during the test lifecycle, to control the execution of code based on that result.

The `ITestResultProvider` can be used to get the test result so far after the first method invokation in a test. It can give you access to if the test is in Passed or Failed state. You can then check the result so far in your test code and choose to call or not call non-test methods based on this.

The annotation `@TestResultProvider` injects a `ITestResultProvider` object into your test class. The Core Manager updates the provider with the test result so far after each `@BeforeClass`, `@Before`, `@Test`, `@After` and `@AfterClass` method.

To use this capability, simply include the lines of code below in your test:

```java
@TestResultProvider
public ITestResultProvider testResultProvider;
```

In the example below, the `@AfterClass` method retrieves the result from the `ITestResultProvider` and checks if it is Failed. If the result is Failed, the method `myCustomCleanupMethod` is called which could contain some diagnostic collection or clean up of resources, which the tester only wants to be run if the test Failed.

```java
@AfterClass
public void afterClassMethod() throws FrameworkException {
    if (testResultProvider.getResult().isFailed()) {
        myCustomCleanupMethod();
    }
}

private void myCustomCleanupMethod() {
    try {
      // Some custom cleanup logic that only happens on failures.
    } catch(Exception ex) {
       logger.error("Failing while cleaning up in myCustomCleanupMethod()");
       // Ignore the problem.
    }
}
```

There can only be a single instance of the test result provider in each test. This is shared between any Galasa test class variables which are marked with the `@TestResultProvider` annotation. It makes no sense having multiple implementations as they all provide the same result when asked.
